# Optional: This tells Railway how to build your project.
# Since you have a requirements.txt and a Dockerfile, 
# Railway often handles this automatically, but it's good practice.

[start]
# This is the CRUCIAL line that fixes the port error.
# It tells Gunicorn to look in your 'app.py' file for the 'app' instance
# and bind to the correct port provided by Railway ($PORT).
